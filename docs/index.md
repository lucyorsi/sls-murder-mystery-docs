*A Halloween party with an optional murder‑mystery game set in a strange tower where memories fade…*

This is a **Halloween party first** and a **game second** — participation is **optional**. Mingle, enjoy costumes, and jump into the game only if you want.

You’ve stepped into the Spire’s secret market. A golden‑masked **Merchant (a dog)** keeps the peace **until 9:00 PM**, when a **murder** will be announced and the investigation begins.

> **Tokens you’ll see tonight**
> - **Votes** = **lima beans** (write initials; drop in suspect jars)
> - **Gold** = **chocolate coins** (**do not eat the gold**)

If you have questions at any time, **ask any host** (the costumed suspects).
