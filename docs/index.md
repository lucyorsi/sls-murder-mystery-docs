## 👋 Intro

Tonight, you’ve slipped into a secret market hidden inside an impossible tower called **the Spire**.  
Once in a while, the powerful beings who guard the Spire call a **truce** and gather for one night of deals, gossip, and games. That gathering is called **the Seventh Bazaar**.

The truce is hosted by **the Merchant**—a beloved, blue-hooded **dog** who keeps everything peaceful and fair. As long as the Merchant presides, no one draws steel, no spells are cast, and we all enjoy the Bazaar in safety.

## 👻 The Murder

Later this evening, a **murder will occur** that shatters the peace and turns this party into an investigation. Before that moment, **no fighting is allowed**—mingle, trade, and enjoy yourselves. When the murder is announced, the game shifts into mystery-and-combat mode.

## 🏆 The Goal

Your goal is to put as many of **your own vote tokens** as possible on the **guilty host**.  
At the reveal, the **guest with the most of their tokens** on that host wins a famed relic of the Spire.

After the murder, short card fights let you **earn extra voting tokens** and **pick up rumors (clues)**. More votes and better information improve your odds of naming the culprit.

## 🎃 Disclaimer

This is a Halloween party first, murder mystery second! The game is totally optional—mingle, hang out, and join the game only if you feel like it.
