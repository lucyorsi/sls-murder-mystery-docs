# How to Play

Start by taking a party bag. It has the following:

- **8 cards**
- **5 voting tokens** (magic beans)
- **2 gold coins** (**don’t eat the gold**).

## The Flow of the Night

- **8:00 PM →** The Bazaar opens. **No fighting or voting yet**, but you can visit the store!
- **9:00 PM →** The murder is announced. From here on:

  - You may **challenge guests or hosts** to quick card fights.
  - Fights help you **earn more votes**, **gain rumors**, and **collect gold**.
  - You can **shop and vote at any time** during this phase.

- **10:45 PM →** Voting deadline.
- **11:00 PM →** We reveal the murderer and crown the winner.

## Why fight at all?

To stack the odds: **more votes** = better chance to win; **more rumors** = better aim for those votes; **more gold** = more potions or votes from the Store.

## Winning

Your aim is to put as many of **your own vote tokens** as possible on the **guilty host**.  
At the reveal, the **guest with the most personal votes** on that host wins (tie → one duel).
