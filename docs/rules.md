# How to Play

You start with **5 voting tokens** (magic beans), **8 cards**, and **2 gold** (chocolate coins — **don’t eat the gold**).

## The Flow of the Night

- **8:00 PM →** The Bazaar opens. **No fighting yet**, but you can already:

  - **Visit the Store** (buy potions or even **extra votes**),
  - **Cast votes** (drop your initialed magic beans in suspect jars),
  - **Listen and talk**—you’ll hear **rumors** (clues) throughout the night.

- **9:00 PM →** The murder is announced. From here on:

  - You may **challenge guests or hosts** to quick card duels.
  - Fights help you **earn more votes**, **gain rumors**, and **collect gold**.
  - You can **shop and vote at any time** while you investigate.

- **By 10:45 PM →** Voting deadline.
- **11:00 PM →** We reveal the murderer and crown the winner.

> **Why fight at all?** To stack the odds: **more votes** = better chance to win; **more rumors** = better aim for those votes; **more gold** = more potions or votes from the Store.

## The Loop (after 9 PM)

**Talk → Vote → Duel → Shop → Repeat**

- **Talk** to hosts/guests to hear rumors (see _Rumors_ page for truth rules).
- **Vote** whenever you feel confident (don’t wait if you’re sure).
- **Duel** to win **votes / rumors / gold** (see _Fights & Rewards_ for details).
- **Shop** anytime for **potions** or **extra votes**.

## Winning

Your aim is to put as many of **your own vote tokens** as possible on the **guilty host**.  
At the reveal, the **guest with the most personal votes** on that host wins (tie → one duel).
