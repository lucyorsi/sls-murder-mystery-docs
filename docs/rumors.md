# Rumors (Clues)

**What is a rumor?**  
A **short, verbal** piece of information that may be useful in identifying the murder.

## How you get / share rumors (summary)

- **From fights:** Rumors change hands as part of fight outcomes (guest↔guest and guest↔host).  
  _You’ll earn or exchange rumors based on who won or drew—see the Fights page for exact rewards._
- **From guests:** Guests may **share or trade** rumors at any time.

## Truth rules

- **Hosts tell the truth** as they know it — **except the guilty host**, who **may lie**.
- **Guests do not lie.** When you share a rumor, share a **true** one (paraphrasing is fine).
