# Fights & Rewards

Fights start only **after 9:00 PM**.

## Health
- **Guests start fights at 6 HP.**
- **Hosts start fights at 10 HP.**
- **Everyone heals back to full** immediately after each combat ends.

## Turn Loop
1. Shuffle your deck and **draw 3**.
2. **Select:** From your hand, secretly choose **2** cards.
3. **Reveal & Resolve (simultaneous):**
   - Flip both players’ cards; apply all text.
   - **Damage you take** = (damage dealt to you) − (your total block this turn).
   - **Potions** (**hosts only**) can be taken at any point in the turn; they resolve with the cards.
4. **Reset:** Discard your entire hand and the 2 played cards, then **draw 3**.
   - If your draw pile is empty, shuffle your discard to form a new draw pile.

**Fight ends:** If someone hits **0 HP**, they lose. If **both** hit 0 HP on the same turn, it’s a **draw**. Then **heal to full**.
